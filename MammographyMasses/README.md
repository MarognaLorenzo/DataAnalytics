# Practical Assignment 1 - Data Analytics Course

## University of Utrecht

This README.md file provides an overview of the practical assignment for the Data Analytics course at the University of Utrecht. The assignment involves working with a dataset of mammographic results, performing data cleaning, preprocessing, dataset exploration, and feature engineering.

### Dataset Information

- **Dataset Name:** Mammographic_masses_data.csv
- **Dataset Description:** toy dimension dataset with less than 1000 rows and 6 features (BA, Age, Density, Shape, Margin, Severity)

### Assignment Goals

The primary objectives of this assignment are as follows:

1. **Data Cleaning:** Clean the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Prepare the dataset for analysis by performing tasks such as scaling, encoding categorical variables, and splitting data into training and testing sets.

3. **Dataset Exploration:** Gain insights into the dataset through summary statistics, data visualizations, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

4. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the dataset.
