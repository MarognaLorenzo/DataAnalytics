# Data Analytics Course Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Data Analytics course repository from the University of Utrecht, completed during the Erasmus program. This repository contains the work of my group for the course INFOB2DA.

## Assignments

The repository is organized into four assignments, each located in its own folder. Here's a brief overview of each assignment:

1. **Assignment 1: Data Understanding and Preprocessing**
    - Description: The students are given a dataset of anonymous mammographic masses. Core problem is to expore some basic functionalities for visualitazion, data understanding and data reduction (PCA, TSVD)
    - Folder: [Mammography masses](https://github.com/MarognaLorenzo/Mammography_dataset_analysis)
2. **Assignment 2: Dashboard visualization and coordinated view**
    - Description: The aim is now for the students to create a dashboard to visualize interactivly some insight of the dataset, reguarding the american flight's delays in 2008. We used Plotly to generate said dashboard.
    - Folder: [Airlines delay](https://github.com/MarognaLorenzo/Airlines_delay)
3. **Assignment 3: Clustering methods and distance functions**
    - Description: The students are given a dataset of customer behaviour on a certain online shopping platform. The aim is to apply clustering algorithms to identify different types of customers through algorithms like BIRCH or DBSCAN.
    - Folder: [Online shoppers intentions](https://github.com/MarognaLorenzo/Online_shoppers_intentions)
4. **Assignment 4: Classification methods and model evaluation**
    - Description: The aim is for the students to apply some classification algorithms to predict if a blood donator will come back to the clinic in the following month. Some of the techinques are for example KNN e SVC.
    - Folder: [Blood transfusion](https://github.com/MarognaLorenzo/Blood_Transfusion)
