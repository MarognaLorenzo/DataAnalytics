# Practical Assignment 2 - Data Analytics Course

## University of Utrecht

This README.md file provides an overview of the practical assignment for the Data Analytics course at the University of Utrecht. The assignment involves creating an interactive and coordinated dashboard for visualizing the American Flight Delays dataset for the year 2008. This was a group work in a team of 3 people.

### Dataset Information

- **Dataset Name:** American Flight Delays (2008)
- **Dataset Description:** More than 1 million datapoints with 30 different features e.g Arrival Delay, Taxi-in time, Origin of the flight, Unique Carrier and so on.

### Assignment Goals

The primary objectives of this assignment are as follows:

1. **Dashboard Creation:** Build an interactive and coordinated dashboard using data from the American Flight Delays dataset for 2008.

2. **Data Visualization:** Use the dashboard to visualize and explore the dataset. Create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore flight delays, cancellations, and other relevant information.

3. **Coordinated Interactions:** Ensure that interactions between different components of the dashboard are coordinated. For example, selecting a specific airline in one chart should update information in other charts accordingly.

4. **Dataset Exploartion:** Use the experience from [Practical Assignment 1](https://github.com/MarognaLorenzo/Mammography_dataset_analysis) to get through the dataset and decide what will be shown in the dashboard

### Dependencies

- Python 3.7+
- Dash 
- Plotly 
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
